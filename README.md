Image editing program

Program for editing and modifying ppm images.

Some of the functions available: 
   -Transform the image from color to black-white
   -Apply various filters
   -Rotate the image
   -Adjust the brightness of the image
   -Adjust the contrast of the image

Input : .ppm image (make sure the image is in the same folder as the program)
Output: image_edit.ppm image with the applied modifications

How to use:
Enter the file name (I added a .ppm image in the repository for easier testing with the name "bird.ppm"), and then you may select any option from the menu.
If you want to apply multiple modifications on the same image, please select the "Use modified image" option, when asked what file you want to use.
After you close the program you will find in the same folder a file with the name "image_edit.ppm" which contains all the modifications.
